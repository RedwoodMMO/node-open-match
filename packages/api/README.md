The `@open-match` NPM scope is unofficial and not affiliated with Google.

## Open Match API

This package contains types and [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) helpers for using the HTTP interfaces from [Open Match](https://openmatch.dev/site/). They are generated using [swagger-axios-codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-axios-codegen) against the official [Swagger interface definitions](https://openmatch.dev/site/swaggerui/index.html).
